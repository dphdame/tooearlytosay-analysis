# Better Access, Higher Vulnerability: The Food Access Paradox

Replication materials for ["Better Access, Higher Vulnerability"](https://tooearlytosay.com/food-access-vulnerability-paradox/)

## Overview

This analysis reveals a counterintuitive pattern: some California census tracts with excellent grocery access still show high food security vulnerability. The paradox emerges from the gap between physical proximity and economic accessibility.

## Data Sources

| Dataset | Source | Access |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Demographics | ACS 2018-2022 | Census API |
| Store locations | SafeGraph (2023) | Commercial |
| Transit stops | Cal-ITP GTFS (2024) | data.ca.gov |

## Methodology

### Vulnerability Index

Five weighted components (0-1 scale each):

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Food access distance | 25% |
| Poverty rate | 25% |
| Renter percentage | 20% |
| Minority percentage | 15% |
| Sprawl index | 15% |

### Analysis

1. Calculate composite vulnerability index for all 9,033 CA tracts
2. Identify tracts with good access (distance <1 mile) but high vulnerability (>0.6)
3. Characterize these "paradox" tracts demographically
4. Test correlation between access and vulnerability controlling for income
